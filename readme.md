# End-to-End Deep Learning Tutorial for Image Classification: Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Ray Scans

In this tutorial notebook, I cover the basics of image classification, following the proposed machine learning workflow using TensorFlow and the MedMNIST dataset of medical images. I may in the future make a version with PyTorch. Do let me know if interested in that.
